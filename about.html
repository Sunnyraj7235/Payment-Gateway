              >Spark is India’s leading independent child rights’ Foundation,
              which works in 18 states of the country. Beginning its journey in
              2008 in India, and registered as ‘Bal Raksha Bharat’, we have
              changed the lives of more than 11 million (1.1 crore) children. We
              firmly believe that every child deserves the best chance for a
              bright future, which is why, we are fiercely committed to ensure
              that children not only survive, but thrive. With a bold ambition
              and a powerful vigilance, we do whatever it takes to save the
              children. In India and across the world, Shiksha works on-ground –
              every day and especially, in times of crisis. Our pioneering
              programs address children’s unique needs; giving them a healthy
              start, an opportunity to learn as well as protection from harm.
              When crisis strikes, we are always among the first to respond and
              the last to leave. We are the outspoken champions for children,
              ensuring that their voices are heard and their issues are given
              top priority. Drawing on a century of leading expertise, we take
              on the toughest challenges, facing the hardest-to-reach children –
              especially those unfairly excluded from the world’s progress. </i
